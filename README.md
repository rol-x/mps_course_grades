Inspired by the laziness of a laboratory head teacher in publishing the grades without coding the names of students, I started performing in-depth analysis of our performance to spice up the competition. This notebook contains a final overview of the scores acquired in this course including overall performance scoreboard, comparisons of all lab exercises and functions detecting students who worked together. The real names have been changed in the source file for demonstration purposes.
